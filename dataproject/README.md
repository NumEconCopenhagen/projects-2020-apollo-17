# Data analysis project

Our project is titled 'Income and Life Expectancy in the Danish Municipalities' and is about development in the average income before taxation and life expectancy across most Danish municipalities.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets** directly from Statistics Denmark's website:

1. The table INDKP105 from statistikbanekn.dk/INDKP105
1. The table LIV01 from statistikbanekn.dk/LIV01

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``

``pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst``
