# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **A Simple Model of The Labour Market**. In this project, we look at two versions of a simple model of the labour market. First, we will look at the model with a production function with a constant marginal product of labour. Then, we extend the model with a bit more realistic production function with decreasing marginal product of labour. We will both look at the implications of changing the production function for the equilibrium of the model, and how it changes the methods needed to solve the model numerically. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject_final.ipynb](modelproject_final.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
